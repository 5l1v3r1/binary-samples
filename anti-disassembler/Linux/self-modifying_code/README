		  A few notes on self-modifying code
		  ==================================

Self-modifying code may be categorized in several types which raise
different kinds of problems for disassemblers.

A program is said to use self-modifying code of type 'n', if at least
one of its instructions is being rewritten 'n' times with at least one
execution of the instruction occurring in between the writes.

Note that, self-modifying code of type 0 occurs when a rewrite of the
memory occurs prior to any execution of the rewritten memory. This
kind of self-modifying code is found in packers and cryptors.

Self-modifying code of type 1 (or any n > 0) occurs when the rewrite
happen after an execution of the rewritten memory area.
